Repo Usage Instructions:
1. When you copy and paste a file to this repo update the 
README to contain where said file is located.
Ex. file_x: protean/runtime/file_x
2. DO NOT add an entire foler of protean or LLVM to repo. 
Only add files that you personally modified and tell us 
where they are found.
3. If you created a file that might need an explanation 
provide it in the README.
4. If you created a file that might need instructions that
are not provided in the file (eg. setup instructions)
provide those instructions here.
5. If you are confused with how to use git don't be afraid
to use the UI client, it doesn't make you any less of a 
person. Or at the very least search what command you want to run.

File Explanations:
-cfg.origcfg.pdf: cfg for original test case before 
                    compiling with pc++
-cfg.protean.pdf: cfg of one of two bitcode files generated 
                    by pc++. Hypothesis is this is after
                    protean virtualizes the function
-cfg.protean.protean.pdf: cfg of one of two bitcode files 
                    generated by pc++. Hypothesis is this is 
                    after protean adds in instructions to 
                    call protean version of a function
