                        Team Self Evaluation Form


Each team must submit one copy of this form. The members of each team should
describe each group member's contribution in detail, and all members should
agree on this form before submission. Feel free to add more entries if your
group has more than 3 members.

A. Gordon Jones (35%)
    1. Downloaded and installed protean on each group memberâ€™s caen account, showed them how to run it
    2. Added core IR instrumentation to keep track of basic block execution
    3. Figured out how to pass arguments from protean_pass to protean_rt functions
    4. Assisted in adding code to protean_pass that called protean_rt functions to extract profiling data
    5. Assisted in figuring out how to pass the string variable in llvm function call
    6. Assisted in writing runtime functions that maintain basic block execution

B. Aditya Shankar (25%)
    1. Added code to protean_pass to call profiling run time function at the end of each function of the program being compiled.
    2. Figured out how to successfully pass a string variable in an llvm function call for the function name.
    3. Wrote Runtime functions to maintain basic block execution counts and output

C. Alex Lancaster (20%)
    1. Edited LLVM and protean pass to make profiling optional
    2. Helped figure out how to pass a freaking string variable in an llvm function
    3. Helped setup SPECCPU benchmark
    4. Debugged cfgs and program

C. Jaleel Salhi (20%)
    1. Wrote the paper
    2. Debugged cfgs and program
